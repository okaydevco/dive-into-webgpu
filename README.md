### About the Tutorial

We are going to build a landing page containing 4 independent WebGPU scenes. Each scene will have its own HTML Canvas Element that we will use for rendering our objects.

Here is a brief overview of the various scenes and what you’ll learn:

- Draw multiple meshes, position them so they always fit in the viewport, and add a basic Lambert shader.
- Create a DOM-synced planes gallery and add a post-processing pass to distort them on scroll.
- Load a glTF object, sync its size and position with an HTML element, add the ability to rotate it on drag, and change its base color when clicking on a set of buttons.
- Create a particle system using instanced billboarded quads, use compute shaders to set and update the particles’ positions and velocities, and finally add shadows.
